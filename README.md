Summary
------
For the Intuit Coding Jam 2017, my team produced this protoype to help freelancers. 
By targeting employers, "Grid" allows a natural network growth from the note-taking functionality of the web app. 
This "side-effect" results in a network where in both employers and freelancers will be enticed to join, eventually growing into a centralized area for both groups. 

Employers will use the app for note-taking for prior connections, as well as contributing to the network with these notes and reviews. 
Freelancers will use the app to visualize their network to secure future work. 
With a sufficient client base, employers would use this network to find freelancers.
